        <h1 class="post-title">Why we need good teachers</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>I was among the 20 students listening to our friend's seminar on  something related to the Internet of Things. Maddy was the teacher, and  he was more excited than ever. He has this habit of interrupting people  to ask us digressing (but often interesting) questions. So he started  talking about the entire deal with the IoT revolution that's about to  sweep the world. He asked us to forget everything we'd heard about it,  and we started thinking about it in the most abstract way possible. Just  something that's needed, some tools at disposal, each with its own  function, and just putting them together. That's how I like it,  everything simplified. No bs. It's called the Top-Down approach.</p><p>Anyway,  all these discussions with him rekindled interest in my dying intellect  and I imagined how interesting it would be to learn every concept in  the same way. But oopsie, I had already passed that phase. My  Engineering's almost done with almost zeros f's given to learning  something, with no teachers. Oh, I wish there were no teachers, instead  of these absolutely worthless teaching assistants. Now I really have to  vent out my swelling frustration.</p><p>Having no professors and managing a college with just (talentless)teaching assistants has many future-ruining cons:</p><p>A popular myth among students is "I can study on my own, I can manage with no teachers".</p><p>Okay,  you probably could, but lazy ones like me need someone pushing them to  listen to lectures and study on their own. We need incentive or a motive  of some sort to continue studying.</p><p>2.You don't  know how fast to  go. If you're stuck on a doubt, there's no one other than the internet  to help you. You might enter a limbo. Of course, you could eventually  get it cleared, but it comes at the cost of precious time.</p><p>3. You  write the exams mugging up, or end up not writing much(like me). Marks  aside, you eventually gain very little knowledge of the subject.</p><p>4. The worst of all is that you don't realise that you aren't learning anything at all till the very very end.</p><p>EXAMPLE</p><p>I  was trying to learn something from an MIT lecture on Youtube, and it  took me more than 3 weeks to completely grasp what was being taught  within one hour. Maybe I'm dumb, but I think all of us at our college  are too, in that case.</p><p>The cons mentioned so far are pretty obvious. The not so obvious ones are:</p><p>Apart from instilling mediocre knowledge, a sense of being fine with it comes free. That's the dangerous part.</p><p>THE UPSHOT:</p><p>Time's lost</p><p>Potential of the mind is wasted on frivolous things.</p><p>The most important and a concealed impact:</p><p>Everyone's  fine with it, and don't mind it; the condition doesn't change, the  nation keeps producing untalented graduates, the nation remains  underdeveloped.</p><p>Give us more (worthy)teachers please !</p><p>PS: Maddy was initially irritating, but later in the evening, was at his best, breaking abstractions, and making things simpler.</p>
