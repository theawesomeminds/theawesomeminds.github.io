While this setting is enabled, all search engine optimisation features will be switched off to help keep your site under the radar.</p><p>Do remember though, this is <em>not</em> secure authentication. You shouldn't rely on this feature for protecting important private data. It's just a simple, shared pass-phrase for some very basic privacy.</p><hr><h1 id="invite-your-team">Invite your team </h1><p>Ghost has a number of different user roles for your team:</p><p><strong>Contributors</strong><br>This is the base user level in Ghost. Contributors can create and edit their own draft posts, but they are unable to edit drafts of others or publish posts. Contributors are <strong>untrusted</strong> users with the most basic access to your publication.</p><p><strong>Authors</strong><br>Authors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Authors can write, edit  and publish their own posts. Authors are <strong>trusted</strong> users. If you don't trust users to be allowed to publish their own posts, they should be set as Contributors.</p><p><strong>Editors</strong><br>Editors are the 3rd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an Author can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well as their own. Editors can also invite new Contributors+Authors to the site.</p><p><strong>Administrators</strong><br>The top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do everything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site settings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full access to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.<br><br><strong>The Owner</strong><br>There is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which has all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The Owner can never be deleted. And in some circumstances the owner will have access to additional special settings if applicable. For example: billing details, if using <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/"><strong>Ghost(Pro)</strong></a>.</p><blockquote><em>It's a good idea to ask all of your users to fill out their user profiles, including bio and social links. These will populate rich structured data for posts and generally create more opportunities for themes to fully populate their design.</em></blockquote><p>Next up: <a href="http://localhost:2368/organising-content/">Organising your content</a> </p>]]&gt;</encoded></item><item><title></title><description></description><link>http://localhost:2368/organising-content/<guid ispermalink="false">5c4f2852c82b8915243fff2b</guid><category></category><creator></creator><pubdate>Mon, 28 Jan 2019 16:05:40 GMT</pubdate><content url="https://static.ghost.org/v2.0.0/images/organising-your-content.jpg" medium="image"></content><encoded><p>Ghost has a flexible organisational taxonomy called<strong> tags</strong> which can be used to configure your site structure using <strong>dynamic routing</strong>. </p><h1 id="basic-tagging">Basic Tagging</h1><p>You can think of tags like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.</p><p>When you create content for your publication you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. </p><p>For example you may tag some content with  News and other content with Podcast, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on <code>/tag/news/</code> and <code>/tag/weather/</code>, respectively.</p><p>If you tag a post with both <code>News</code> <em>and</em> <code>Weather</code> - then it appears in both sections. Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.</p><h1 id="the-primary-tag">The primary tag</h1><p>Inside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. </p><blockquote><em><strong>News</strong>, Technology, Startup</em></blockquote><p>So you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add related tags which are less important.</p><h1 id="private-tags">Private tags</h1><p>Sometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't necessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.</p><p>For example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.</p><blockquote><em><strong>News</strong>, #video</em></blockquote><p>Here, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of News - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with #video. In your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting. </p><blockquote><em>You can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost's extensive <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/api/handlebars-themes/">theme documentation</a>.</em></blockquote><h1 id="dynamic-routing">Dynamic Routing</h1><p>Dynamic routing gives you the ultimate freedom to build a custom publication to suit your needs. Routes are rules that map URL patterns to your content and templates. </p><p>For example, you may not want content tagged with <code>News</code> to exist on: <code>example.com/tag/news</code>. Instead, you want it to exist on <code>example.com/news</code> . </p><p>In this case you can use dynamic routes to create customised collections of content on your site. It's also possible to use multiple templates in your theme to render each content type differently.</p><p>There are lots of use cases for dynamic routing with Ghost, here are a few common examples: </p><ul><li>Setting a custom home page with its own template</li><li>Having separate content hubs for blog and podcast, that render differently, and have custom RSS feeds to support two types of content</li><li>Creating a founders column as a unique view, by filtering content created by specific authors</li><li>Including dates in permalinks for your posts</li><li>Setting posts to have a URL relative to their primary tag like <code>example.com/europe/story-title/</code><br></li></ul><blockquote><em>Dynamic routing can be configured in Ghost using <a href="http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">YAML</a> files. Read our dynamic routing <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/concepts/routing/">documentation</a> for further details.</em></blockquote><p>You can further customise your site using <a href="http://localhost:2368/apps-integrations/">Apps &amp; Integrations</a>.</p>]]&gt;</encoded></item><item><title></title><description></description><link>http://localhost:2368/apps-integrations/<guid ispermalink="false">5c4f2852c82b8915243fff29</guid><category></category><creator></creator><pubdate>Mon, 28 Jan 2019 16:05:39 GMT</pubdate><content url="https://static.ghost.org/v2.0.0/images/app-integrations.jpg" medium="image"></content><encoded><p>There are three primary ways to work with third-party services in Ghost: using Zapier, editing your theme, or using the Ghost API.</p><h1 id="zapier">Zapier</h1><p>You can connect your Ghost site to over 1,000 external services using the official integration with <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>.</p><p>Zapier sets up automations with Triggers and Actions, which allows you to create and customise a wide range of connected applications.</p><blockquote><strong>Example</strong>: When someone new subscribes to a newsletter on a Ghost site (Trigger) then the contact information is automatically pushed into MailChimp (Action).</blockquote><p><strong>Here are the most popular Ghost&lt;&gt;Zapier automation templates:</strong> </p><script src="https://zapier.com/apps/embed/widget.js?services=Ghost&amp;container=true&amp;limit=8"></script>
<h1 id="editing-your-theme">Editing your theme</h1><p>One of the biggest advantages of using Ghost over centralised platforms is that you have total control over the front end of your site. Either customise your existing theme, or create a new theme from scratch with our <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/api/handlebars-themes/">Theme SDK</a>. </p><p>You can integrate <em>any</em> front end code into a Ghost theme without restriction, and it will work just fine. No restrictions!</p><p><strong>Here are some common examples</strong>:</p><ul><li>Include comments on a Ghost blog with <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/integrations/disqus/">Disqus</a> or <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/integrations/discourse/">Discourse</a></li><li>Implement <a href="https://help.ghost.org/article/89-mathjax">MathJAX</a> with a little bit of JavaScript</li><li>Add syntax highlighting to your code snippets using <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism.js</a></li><li>Integrate any dynamic forms from <a href="https://www.google.com/forms/">Google</a> or <a href="https://www.typeform.com/">Typeform</a> to capture data</li><li>Just about anything which uses JavaScript, APIs and Markup.</li></ul><h1 id="using-the-public-api">Using the Public API</h1><p>Ghost itself is driven by a set of core APIs, and so you can access the Public Ghost JSON API from external webpages or applications in order to pull data and display it in other places.</p><blockquote>The Ghost API is <a href="https://docs.ghost.org/api/">thoroughly documented</a> and straightforward to work with for developers of almost any level. </blockquote><p>Alright, the last post in our welcome-series!

Not all of them, some of them. Topping that list are  those from summer 2015, when I had no classes, and would go on endless  walks in svu. Ah, magical they were! The Black Keys conquered my head as  I walked the roads with my little earphones, along with a few jumps and  jogs. That was the time I was preparing for the Gre, the first exam I  actually, whole heartedly wanted to ace, and gave it all I could. I was  in the zone ! I'd go on a ride on my bike, always making sure I took the  longer paths to svu, just slowly cruising, bobbing my head to the  music. I'd park at the Dst purse center (still no idea what it means),  and start the hour long walk. I'd kick off with some words, walking and  trying to memorize new ones everyday. And proceed to the parallel bars  at H block, try and fail doing 10 reps, and continue the walk. There  would always be someone playing cricket at the ground there. After  getting bored, I'd resume French with Michel Thomas from where I left  off, uttering the words as he waits for my prompts. I'd tame dogs on the  roads, look at the sun and the sky, sit by the benches, run till I got  tired, get on my bike and tour svu again, and take the longest path back  home. I'd wake up at 2 pm, sleep at 5 am. Okay, we're drifting away  from our plan of action.</p><p>I'm gonna try and recreate that  experience again. I've completely lost touch of vocab (which is clearly  evident) and Michel Thomas is sulking that I'm not listening to his rant  anymore. Moreover, I've gotta start spanish from August this year,  which means I have 4 months to complete the audio, and practise as well.  C'est la vie ! And the highlight of this program, Renaissance3.0, I'm  gonna start serious blogging again. Not the casual type, like the recent  ones, but actual organized thoughts put into words that make sense. I  feel like I lose out by not documenting the ideas I have or theories I  come up with. Don't want to end up like Ramanujan now, do we? Okay,  wait, why not start right now? No, not right now. Save it dude, calm  down. Okay, how about just posting the titles for the articles and  giving the people a glimpse? That sounds alright. Just started playing  Weight of Love. This is gonna be fun.</p><p>And yeah, Im gonna redesign this site. Tired of black now, will make it bright. Oh, and also more short stories!</p><p>+Renaissance3.0</p><p>-Hiding in Plain sight (story)</p><p>-Lost in Translation</p><p>-Do we really exist?</p><p>-Mr J (story)</p><p>That's it for now, take care loved ones!</p><p>Greetings from Florida.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Suraj.</p>]]&gt;</encoded></item><item><title></title><description><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NUbLq7aXJO8/WQRsrP8kpCI/AAAAAAAACr0/aNjQLOIj-T4947WR0RGCyqzMPnDsgkIbQCLcB/s400/KPS_7638-1-3.jpg" class="kg-image"><p>Aapke  maa aur baap kaise hain?

Acche hain? Theek hain, main shuru karta hoon.  Kya aapko Hindi mein baat karna aati hai? Nahi? Toh kya kar rahe hain,  pehle jaake seekhlo varna bahut badi musibat mein phas jaaoge. Aisi vasi  musibat nahi, bahut hi khatarnak wala musibat. Jaise ki Japan mein  tsunami, jaise ki America mein Donald Trump, jaise ki theatre mein  National Anthem. Main ye keh raha hoon ki agar kisi insaan ko kisi cheez  ki jaroorat padti hain toh usko himmat se kuch aur cheeze karna padta  hain. Agar aap ye soch rahe hain ki mujhko ab kis cheez ki jaroorat hain  toh aur sochiye mat. Kyunki main aapko khud bataoonga. Mujhe Hindi  thodi aati hai par main koi Gulzar nahi hoon. Aur mera jija bhi Hindi  bolne wala hain, toh mujhe bhi Hindi mein baatcheet karni padegi. Vaise  bhi mujhe videshi aur deshi bhaashaye seekhna accha lagta hain, toh  maine socha ki kyun na Hindi mein thodi adhyayan kare! Toh ye thi waja  iss Blog ka. Koi visesh cheez pe baat nahi karne wala hoon yaha main.  Sirf saamany cheeze boloonga. Aap isko padke kuch nahi ukhadenge. Sirf  aapki waqt gavaoge. Aapke zindagi badalne waali nahi hain. Samaj gaye  kya? Theek hain, main chalta hoon. Abhi bahut waqt bigad gaya mera.</p><p>Khayal rakho ji apna. Samsaar aur samskaar aur zamaane badal gaye hain.</p><p>Phir milenge chalte hain.</p><p>Pyaar,</p><p>Suraj.</p>]]&gt;</encoded></item><item><title></title><description><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7rqfAhYYkyQ/WQRof5ctSuI/AAAAAAAACrI/V7paJmjqRYQArBtYtylpoD-a-Mto343vACLcB/s400/De.jpg" class="kg-image"><p>Hey,</p><p>Sorry  for not dropping by.

I was busy fighting mighty whales in the great  Atlantic ocean. They were trying to steal my thunder. I had scored  enviably in Algorithms, and they couldn't fathom how superior my cranial  organization is, how elegant my solutions are, and how unparalleled my  wisdom is. Hey, I'm not being pompous here, but a man's gotta flaunt his  achievements once in every while, or the damn whales will try to steal  his thunder. They clap and whistle and flip and flap to distract the  crowd who gather to witness him in all his glory. The crowd is too  docile, and always looks at the flashier lights. Clickbait, in other  words. See the irony? You try to bait them and they outfox you and  clickbait you instead. And you fall for it every single time. I'm just  pointing the obvious truth here, not trying to be offensive to your  bigoted mind. Oops. Sorry for the language. All the anti-nationalist  thoughts are getting in my head now. Blame Anurag Kashyap. That bastard.  Also blame Tanmay, Kanan and the rest of the fringe clan. Now stand up  quick. Jana Gana....YOU SON OF A TERRORIST! HOW DARE YOU NOT STAND UP  WHEN READING THE ANTHEM!</p><p>Okay, enough of the digressive leftist  sermon, now let's get back to the point. Where were we? Right, the  Arctic ocean. The whales here are terrible. Dirty heathens. Oh wait,  they're waving at me. Hi ! Have a good day? Who? Me? Oh my, thank you  sir, and you too ! You be safe out there, there are rogue agents  circling the islands. Oh wait, we were at the Atlantic, not the Arctic!  Ah, now I see the confusion. See, this is what happens when someone  tries to steal your thunder. You have to personally call up Zeus again,  convince him to get this big butt-ed thunder to fall again, and hope  that it won't fall on your head, cos you know, you want to live and make  sure it happened alright. But Zeus is an ass, and it takes some  convincing to get what you want. Which is why I need to first do well  the rest of the semester, and get my thunder back.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Suraj.</p><p>I SAID, STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY!</p>]]&gt;</encoded></item></channel>
