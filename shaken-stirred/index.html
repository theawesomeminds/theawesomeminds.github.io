I was busy fighting mighty whales in the great  Atlantic ocean. They were trying to steal my thunder. I had scored  enviably in Algorithms, and they couldn't fathom how superior my cranial  organization is, how elegant my solutions are, and how unparalleled my  wisdom is. Hey, I'm not being pompous here, but a man's gotta flaunt his  achievements once in every while, or the damn whales will try to steal  his thunder. They clap and whistle and flip and flap to distract the  crowd who gather to witness him in all his glory. The crowd is too  docile, and always looks at the flashier lights. Clickbait, in other  words. See the irony? You try to bait them and they outfox you and  clickbait you instead. And you fall for it every single time. I'm just  pointing the obvious truth here, not trying to be offensive to your  bigoted mind. Oops. Sorry for the language. All the anti-nationalist  thoughts are getting in my head now. Blame Anurag Kashyap. That bastard.  Also blame Tanmay, Kanan and the rest of the fringe clan. Now stand up  quick. Jana Gana....YOU SON OF A TERRORIST! HOW DARE YOU NOT STAND UP  WHEN READING THE ANTHEM!</p><p>Okay, enough of the digressive leftist  sermon, now let's get back to the point. Where were we? Right, the  Arctic ocean. The whales here are terrible. Dirty heathens. Oh wait,  they're waving at me. Hi ! Have a good day? Who? Me? Oh my, thank you  sir, and you too ! You be safe out there, there are rogue agents  circling the islands. Oh wait, we were at the Atlantic, not the Arctic!  Ah, now I see the confusion. See, this is what happens when someone  tries to steal your thunder. You have to personally call up Zeus again,  convince him to get this big butt-ed thunder to fall again, and hope  that it won't fall on your head, cos you know, you want to live and make  sure it happened alright. But Zeus is an ass, and it takes some  convincing to get what you want. Which is why I need to first do well  the rest of the semester, and get my thunder back.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Suraj.</p><p>I SAID, STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY!</p>
