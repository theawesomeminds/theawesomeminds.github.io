        <section class="post-content">
            <p>First post.. I've been thinking a lot lately and a lot of our  theories have also been thought by other people man. It's  frustrating,man!We thought of making a camouflaged car that has LED  covered surfaces and tiny cameras ,whose recordings are projected on the  other sides of the car.. After a few weeks, i got a call from him,  telling me that the same idea was developed by Mercedes Benz for  promoting their hybrid car of some type.We also had an idea that maybe  our entire universe is just a simulation created by a bigger universe  and that we all were merely result of some programs that were coded by  our 'Godfathers'.. Then, there you go, when i was wandering on the  internet,i found some webpage that said that some scientists were  researching the above said idea by trying creating their own little  universe!Also, we found that there was already movie called the  Thirteenth Floor, that had a similar concept.We also had, and have an  aim to transfer all our consciousness to another machine of some kind so  that we'd live forever.. Then , few months later, the trailer for  Transcendence was released, and we had a state of deja vu.One moment,  we've these really bizarre ideas,and the next moment,we're pushed back  to where we were.</p>
